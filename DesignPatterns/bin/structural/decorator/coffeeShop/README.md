# Coffee Shop (Decorator Pattern)

## Problem Space
Imagine a coffee shop that has different toppings (soy, whip, mocha...), different sizes and different coffee types. Maintaining code for every possible variation of coffee will result in a class explosion. This is the working example provided in Head First Design Patterns, which I will be implementing here with some additional logic for business, like tax and discounts. I will explore how the Decorator Pattern is a potential solution to improving the maintainability of such a code-base.

The problem will contain the following themes that will be all solved utilizing Decorator:
 - Beverage
 - Condiment (topping)
 - Pricing
 - Receipt
 
The focus is on the Beverage which will be the core abstraction that everything else will utilize. 

## Overview
Implementation of the Decorator Pattern, which is used to attach responsibilities to a context object dynamically.
