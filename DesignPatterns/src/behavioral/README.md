# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview
This is the head package containing behavioral design patterns. Each design pattern is contained within it's own sub-package and these may each contain multiple projects.
Every project aims to implement a design pattern in a unique way, while avoiding logical complexity. The focus is on the design patterns, not complex code.
Every project should contain a README and UML outlining briefly how the code functions and which design pattern(s) are being used.
Testing has been intentionally avoided due to real life time constrains. The focus of this project is solely on implementing design patterns.
