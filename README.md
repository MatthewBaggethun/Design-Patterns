# Applied Design Patterns

## Overview
This project contains Java-based implementations of various design patterns,
inspired by *Head First Design Patterns*.

## Project Structure
This monolithic repository is separated by three archetypes of design patterns, namely
**behavioral, creational and structural**. Enter any of these file-paths to discover sub-sequent
design patterns belonging to any of the three archetypes.

* [Behavioral](DesignPatterns/src/behavioral/README.md)
    - [Observer Pattern](DesignPatterns/src/behavioral/observer/README.md)
    - [Strategy Pattern](DesignPatterns/src/behavioral/strategy/README.md)
* Creational
* [Structural](DesignPatterns/src/structural/README.md)
	- [Decorator Pattern](DesignPatterns/src/structural/decorator/README.md)

## How to Run
1. Find a cool design pattern you wish to see in action
2. Clone the repository
3. Compile the project
4. Main methods are found within packages containing `Client` in the package name (Ex. weatherStationClient)
