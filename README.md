## Overview
This project contains Java-based implementations of various design patterns,
inspired by *Head First Design Patterns*.

This monolithic repository is separated by three archetypes of design patterns, namely
**behavioral, creational and structural**. Enter any of these file-paths to discover sub-sequent
design patterns belonging to any of the three archetypes.

    - Strategy Pattern
    - Observer Pattern
* Creational
* Structural

## How to Run
1. Find a cool design pattern you wish to see in action
2. Clone the repository
3. Compile the project
4. Main methods are found within packages containing `Client` in the package name (Ex. weatherStationClient)
